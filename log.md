# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 18. Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Started to build fcc technical documentation page.

**Thoughts:** It looked very simple at first and I thoght I would complete it in hour or two. But its layout is not as simple as it look. 
Another thing that I have noticed about myself is that, I really try to copy everything on the example page, Which is  bad I think. Will continue it tommorrow.

### Day 2: September 19. Wednesday
**Today's Progress**: Make some progress on technical page.

**Thoughts:** Sidebar is taking much of time. It have to be fixed and scrollable, and I haven't been able to do even one of them. Will learn two css props, position and overflow. Hope it will help be fixed sidebar as I wanted it to be.

Oh!!! And I also fixed a typo in fcc curriculum on github. :)

### Day 3: September 20. Thursday
**Today's Progress**: Almost completed Technical documentation project

**Thoughts:** In the morning, learned two css props, position and overflow. After that sidebar was fixed just in minutes. Writing documentation text on my own is not possible and copying it is also not easy. It is taking some time. But thanks Allah all the hard work is done now.

### Day 4: September 21. Friday
**Today's Progress**: Started preparing for HTML5 test, Added content in technical documentation page, Learned about length units, detailed intro to CSS grids. Also learned how to stay focus and deep while working. Learned pomodoro technique (25 minutes work/ 5 minutes break) Work on only one related task a time.

**Thoughts:** A long day concluded. Soon after learning technique, workflow jumped to a high. It is not easy to work that long but I managed to stay motivated. Hope this method will speed up work termendously.

### Day 5: September 22. Saturday
**Today's Progress**:Completed technical documentation project(media query is not working fine). Completed layout of final project, personal portfolio. Spend most of the time trying to place at header background. In preparation to html5 test, learned how to used video and audio tags.

**Thoughts:** Despite continues interuption of internet, made some progress. Internet was annoying all the time . Deep and focus work technique is working very well for me.
In the final project I decided to deviate from example design and show my own skills. So started the project with my own colors, and placed an image in header background. Internet is not helpful at all so I decided to quit early.

### Day 6: September 23. Sunday
**Today's Progress**Internet was not working today either, and will be availabe tommorrow also. So I take the opportunity to learn photoshop from a course I previously downloaded. Photoshop is essential to get better at front-end developement as far I know. 

**Thoughts:** Will be taking the time without internet to spend on photoshop. 

### Day 7: September 24. Tuesday
**Today's Progress**:Basic HTML form elements i.e. form, label, input, button.

### Day 9: October 3. Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Made header of the portfolio project. Started JavaScript course 

**Thoughts:** Portfolio's header is still not perfect but at least it has something to show. Colors of the logos didn't changed as I intended. On the other hand I started Andrew Mead's JavaScript course. I now split the day in two halfs. One for working on personal projects and second for the learning of JavaScript.

### Day 10: October 4. Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Added slider to portfolio project. Learn about objects, methods in javascript 

**Thoughts:** After some critical thinking added slider in portfolio. Started a new branch for the header. Then learned about how objects worked with functions and how to use methods.

### Day 11: October 5. Friday

**Today's Progress**: Completed missing parts of slider in portfolio project. Learned how arrays works in JavaScript. Explored Math object. 

**Thoughts:** Now I am really getting sense what it takes to build a web page. First realized that I faild to add all the icons. Then spotted that slider also have controller underneath. So fixed these parts. Andrew Mead's JavaScript bootcamp is just amazing. He taught objects before arrays, which really make sense. Everytime I got confuse with arrays and objects but this time it is clear as hell. Happy on my progress.

### Day 12: October 6. Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Added the content and projects part. Learned different arrays method. 

**Thoughts:** Slowly slowly I am getting pace with building smaller parts of web page. Andrew's course is going fine as well. Late night I read Andre Negoie's article " Learn to code in 2018, get hired, and have fun along the way" It was just amazing. It was full of resources and a path to follow to become web developer and get hired. I decided to take on a course of advance git.

### Day 13: October 7, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Started the day with mastering git course. Then fixed some issues with portfolio project's projects section and added contact section. End the day with more methods of array.

**Thoughts:** Knowing how git works under the hood and all his workflow for team collaboration is essential in modern deveoploer toolkit. That's why I decided to not wait and started mastering git course right away. Buildng portfolio project is easing now. With just only one full fledge project, I'm learning so much that I imagine where would I be after some twenty to twenty-five projects which I have planned. As usual at the end I took some lectures on JavaScript.I'm building todos app along the way. It is very much helping in understanding how javascript works for searching, adding, deleting for arrays of projects. All in all I'm enjoying my time.

### Day 15: October 9, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Learn git reset,rebase. Add about me part of about section in portfolio project. Creat expense tracker and learn DOM manipulation in javascript course. Did some challenges on fcc javascript part.

**Thoughts:** Suddenly, from last week on I started to love my learning time. Medium articles has very much impact on my thinking and how I was working before and I have improved it with time. One thing that I have learned is do not focus on outcome, focus on the process, and you will be much more efficient and less likely to be depressed by your result. This has become a key sentence in my day to day work.

### Day 17: October 11, Tuseday

**Today's Progress**: Experiment with css grid and flexbox. JavaScript in the browser. 

**Thoughts:** I was trying to be good at  css grid and flexbox so that I can use them better in my own projects. So I decided to experiment with them to get a better understanding. It goes well and I discover many aspects to use them for responsive layout. Then learn JavaScript and how to use it in the browser for user interaction. Adding new elements, removing elements, and changing content of an element and all that stuff. 



### Day 18: October 12, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Clean portfolio project to make it more readable. Learn more ways to interact with user in the browser through JavaScript. Read some articles about flexbox at smashing magzine site. 

**Thoughts:** Cool portfolio project had became undreadable and non-workable for me. It has too many redundant files and code was scattered everywhere. Plus slider at two places were making code inconsistant and hard to understand. I clean them all. Learning JavaScript is more enjoying than ever. Flexbox articles was very helpful

### Day 19: October 13, Satureday

**Today's Progress**: Restructure code of portfolio project to make it responsive friendly. Learn about localStorage in javaScript and how to store user input in localStorage 

**Thoughts:** Today, do a lot more than past some days. Really focused on portfolio project code. It was getting worse and I was unable to continue. Now It is better.
I'm in love with JavaScript now. Such a beautiful and powerfull language. Spend several hours on solving different challeneges given in Andrew Mead's course.

### Day 21: October 15, Monday

**Today's Progress**: After a bit of experment, decided to change layout of contact section altogether. Learn how to use checkboxes in the browser with user interacting with them 

**Thoughts:** Although portfolio project is consuming much of my time, but at the same time I'm learning so much things that I think it is worth doing it. It is my first project so sometimes uncertainty engulf me. JavaScript work is going smoothly. I'm understanding every bit of challenge. Now I am forgetting to add entry to log almost every other day so have to do this on next day.

### Day 22: October 16, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Tweak with portfolio project code. Read some chapters of Eloquent JavaScript. Learn Arrow functions in Andrew Mead's JavaScript course.

**Thoughts:** Can't express my feeling how difficult it is for me to make webpage responsive with css grid. Constantly change properties and see the results. It still have problems with some section. JavaScript learning is going smooth. I thought it would be better if I add another learning method so I started reading Eloquent JavaScript.

### Day 23: October 17, Wednesday

**Today's Progress** All of a sudden complete mobile version of cool portfolio project

**Thoughts:** I feel ashamed of myself and wondering what goes wrong with me. I have been trying to make cool portfolio web page responsive and every time I change something It breaks. I said to myself, nothing is wrong with me I just don't have enough knowledge of what I'm doing. I opened css grid specification on mdn and they taught me how to build layouts with "mobile first" approach. I liked it very much and applied it to my own project. And BOOOOM. I must say it looks better in a mobile now. Feeling energetic once again. A big achievment for me.

### Day 24: October 18, Thursday

**Today's Progress** Yahooooooo!!!! I made the web page responsive. Some JavaScript lessons.

**Thoughts:**  Today is the my happiest day of prevoius 2 and halft months. After all of pain and tedious coding exercises It took just two days to make web page responsive when I chose mobile first approach. Now big projects ahead. In javaScript I learn how to use try-catch statement to handle errors. I also truthy and falsy values uses in if statements. An overview of conditional statement. End the day by doing some challenges on FCC. Many of them looks easy but some of them are just confusing and I don't understand what they want from me.

### Day 25: October 19, Friday

**Today's Progress** Object Oriented JavaScript all the way

**Thoughts:** Yesterday, I decided I should focus on JavaScript and give it top priority. I thought I will eventually become better at HTML and CSS but javaScript is essential for modren web developement. Today, how OOP works in javaScript. Andrew explained how objects are created in javaScript and that Arrays are also customized objects whereas string are converted to object if any method is applied.


### Day 26: October 20, Satureday

**Today's Progress** Class syntax and how classes are used in javaScript

**Thoughts:** Again forget to add this entry at time, I learned how classes are used in javaScript and yes they are very powerful


### Day 27: October 21, Sunday

**Today's Progress** Asynchrounous programming, closures, promises

**Thoughts:** Today I learned hardest part of javaScript (in my opinion). But I done almost 90% challenges on my own. My future in JavaScript looks very promising(not what I learned today).


### Day 28: October 22, Monday

**Today's Progress**Webpack, babel 

**Thoughts:** Covered a lot javaScript today. First learn how to use babel and how it convert javaScript to make it compatible for all browsers. Then learn how to use webpack in projects. I love what webpack do and how it manages javaScript files. By learning webpack I am able to understand how it worked in React application as when I took react course I didn't understand what is happening. I am looking forward to start Andrew's React course right away because I find him a great teacher. Just want to get FCC javaScritp data structure and algorithm certificate in between, because it is fun too.


### Day 29: October 23, Tuesday

**Today's Progress** rest operator, spread operator, destructuring and some fcc challenges 

**Thoughts:** Completed JavaScript course. Was 50/50 on what to start next. A javaScript project or React. Then choose React but decide I should do it after fcc JavaScript algorithm and Data structure certificate. To get some rest and to get some experience.

### Day 30: October 24, Wednesday

**Today's Progress** FCC datastructure and basic algorithm challenges

**Thoughts:** I was tired throughout the day. Taking no break at all for the past two months start affecting my work quality. My productivity has started to damage as my eyes almost souring all the time. So I decided I should take satureday and sunday off. Health is important for productivity. Nonetheless today I complete two sections of javaScript datastructure and algorithm.


### Day 31: October 27, Satureday

**Today's Progress** Basic script challenges, React Introduction

**Thoughts:**  I took days off, my health was deterioating because of constant work and not taking a single day off. Today I done a mix of React course and fcc challenges. Done quite a bit of both of them.
