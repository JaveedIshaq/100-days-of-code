# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 8. Sunady

**Today's Progress**: Started to build fcc technical documentation page.

**Thoughts:** It looked very simple at first and I thoght I would complete it in hour or two. But its layout is not as simple as it look. 
Another thing that I have noticed about myself is that, I really try to copy everything on the example page, Which is  bad I think. Will continue it tommorrow.

### Day 2: September 9. Monday
**Today's Progress**: Make some progress on technical page.

**Thoughts:** Sidebar is taking much of time. It have to be fixed and scrollable, and I haven't been able to do even one of them. Will learn two css props, position and overflow. Hope it will help be fixed sidebar as I wanted it to be.

Oh!!! And I also fixed a typo in fcc curriculum on github. :)

### Day 3: September 10. Tuseday
**Today's Progress**: Almost completed Technical documentation project

**Thoughts:** In the morning, learned two css props, position and overflow. After that sidebar was fixed just in minutes. Writing documentation text on my own is not possible and copying it is also not easy. It is taking some time. But thanks Allah all the hard work is done now.

### Day 4: September 11. Wednesday
**Today's Progress**: Started preparing for HTML5 test, Added content in technical documentation page, Learned about length units, detailed intro to CSS grids. Also learned how to stay focus and deep while working. Learned pomodoro technique (25 minutes work/ 5 minutes break) Work on only one related task a time.

**Thoughts:** A long day concluded. Soon after learning technique, workflow jumped to a high. It is not easy to work that long but I managed to stay motivated. Hope this method will speed up work termendously.

### Day 5: September 12. Thursday
**Today's Progress**:Completed technical documentation project(media query is not working fine). Completed layout of final project, personal portfolio. Spend most of the time trying to place at header background. In preparation to html5 test, 

**Thoughts:** Despite continues interuption of internet, made some progress. Internet was annoying all the time . Deep and focus work technique is working very well for me.
In the final project I decided to deviate from example design and show my own skills. So started the project with my own colors, and placed an image in header background. Internet is not helpful at all so I decided to quit early.

### Day 6: September 13. Friday
**Today's Progress**Internet was not working today either, and will be availabe tommorrow also. So I take the opportunity to learn photoshop from a course I previously downloaded. Photoshop is essential to get better at front-end developement as far I know. 

**Thoughts:** Will be taking the time without internet to spend on photoshop. 

### Day 7: September 14. Saturday
**Today's Progress**:Basic HTML form elements i.e. form, label, input, button.
Photoshop's layers panel, layers types and layers selection etc.
